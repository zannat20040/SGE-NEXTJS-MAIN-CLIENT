By 1928, with support from entrepreneur Jesse Boot, the college gained financial independence and relocated to Highfields, inaugurated by King George V. In 1934, it evolved into the College of Art, a leading institution. After WWII, the Arkwright Building became the Nottingham and District Technical College, meeting the demand for skilled workers. The Nottinghamshire Farm Institute opened in 1949 to improve agricultural education, and the Technical College expanded significantly with the Newton Building in 1958, accommodating 7,000 students.
